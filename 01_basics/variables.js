//variables can be form in different patterns
//const accountID or const account_ID or accountId just remember it should be remember easily
// javascript have some concept keywords which do action according to commands that can be done by v8 enjine or node.js
// like if you get var, let or const then assign it to memory..... and console.log uses for print output...

//const means constant value and it wont changes  vs Var means value can be changes
const accountId = 12345
//accountId = 3 // not allowed to change cause we use ...const...
let accountEmail = "kumud@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "1234"
accountCity = "Delhi"

console.log(accountId);
